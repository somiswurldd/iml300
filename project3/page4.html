        From one of the most influential anime movies of all time, comes the main protagonist, Chihiro. She leads the movie Spirited Away, a film about the rite of passage into adulthood. Chihiro is a great example of what a dynamic young woman acts like. She’s kind, whiny, emotional, courageous, harsh, hardworking and brilliant! Her character shows that women are not as simple as good and bad. That little girls are not dramatic and “sissy”. The concept of manhood is deemed as an important part of a boy’s life, but what about becoming a woman? The absence of a male savior in this film is refreshing, and although there is a romance, it does not consume her character. Spirited Away not only won an Oscar for best animated film in 2001, but is also the highest grossing film in Japanese history. Chihiro is proof that audiences want to watch our stories, if you give us the chance to tell it.
