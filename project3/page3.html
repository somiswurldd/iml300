                “You know what, that’s what’s wrong with modern women. You don’t know how to take a damn compliment anymore. I swear all of you think men are dogs or something. Like, fuck, if I cant even compliment you, how am i supposed to date? I'm so tired of being scared of being called a creep. What the hell is wrong with me telling you to smile? It’s a positive thing. Fuck”

                “When my dad died, I rode the subway home from the hospital. I was looking at my feet watching my tears hit my shoelaces, minding my own damn business. Then, what did I hear?”

                “NO!! That’s the problem. You don't know. I can’t even cry without you telling me I should look happy. Fuck my dad. Fuck a funeral. I should be smiling because YOU think its pretty. It’s selfish and I hate you.”

            </p>
            <p id="text-9">
                “Hate me? You don’t think that’s a little harsh?”

                “You know what’s harsh? Ten years ago it was hot if you starved yourself to death and now if your ass and tits aren’t two times the size of your waist, you’re meant to die alone.”

                “Jesus. Don’t you think you’re being a little dramatic?”
